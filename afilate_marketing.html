<h1>Best way to make money from home (Affilate marketing)</h1>
<h5>28.June.2022</h5>
<img class="article-photo" src="img/affilate_marketing.webp">
<p>Affiliate marketing is an online version of regular sales, which has three basic components: the product or service being sold;
  a trader who offers the product or service and an affiliate (partner) who receives a certain percentage from the sale in the form 
 of a commission.
 
 Affiliation marketing is practically promoting products from other people in which a commission is obtained from each sale. 
 It is one of the most popular ways to promote and sell online products. And while in our region, this method is still in its infancy,
  a large sum of money is earned on the world market this way.
 </p>
<br>
<h2>Introduction to Affilate marketing!</h2>

<p>The definition of affiliation marketing will explain the process of this type of promotion in more detail. It is a field of digital marketing where by promoting products or services on our site, we refer the future customer to the manufacturer's site or the one who offers services. If a purchase is made according to our recommendation, we receive a percentage of the manufacturer's sale.

  Unlike the execution of an online store, in this case, you don't have to worry about direct sales, product storage, warranty and similar things. Your part of the work is to persuade the reader, the potential customer, to click on the product link. He will take him later on the site where the specific sale of the product takes place.
  
  In this way, you can earn money on interesting products for your audience, without having to have them physically. In other words, you make money on the products of others that you promote on your site. When you promote a product, all you have to do is wait for visitors to convert into customers. In doing so, you have no responsibility in the event of product failure or bad service. You are just someone connecting both sides.
  
  An additional advantage works at home, more precisely anywhere on the planet. This type of specific marketing does not require any meeting, or even the introduction to the end customer. The only thing that should interest you is how much you can win and how reliable the seller is.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Basic elements of affiliation marketing</h3>
  <p>In this promotion and sale process, everyone does what is good. Marketing promotes the product for a percentage, and the seller gains additional sales, which he would probably not have. In this way, everyone focuses on their business - there are many prosperous companies that promote a complete promotion thanks to an affiliate program.

    Thanks to this form of marketing, different types of promotions are obtained, because the manufacturer is not interested in the way you write about the product. Namely, the subsidiary is not an official representative of the company, so there is greater freedom in communication with consumers.
    
    it has practically three important segments, namely: seller or manufacturer of products / services, partners (subsidiaries) and consumers. Of course, this means you have a good quality marketing plan to make it work.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Service provider or manufacturer</h4>

    <p>To start a chain of events, you need to move on from the basic thing - the product. To get started, you need someone to have something they want to sell. These can be specific products such as video games, lamps, pictures, cameras ... On the other hand, services such as travel packages, online meetings, astrology, commercial advice, etc.
      Due to the specific promotional form, the manufacturer does not participate in the creation of promotional activities or does not pay for them. It is only to approve the promotion of the product on a certain website (or social network) and Arrival of new customers.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Affiliate (Partner)</h4>
      <p>The main driver of this type of marketing is the partner who promotes the product to his audience who, after buying it through him, earns a certain percentage of sales.
        Take for example you have a well-known travel website. You make a post in which you say what equipment you use and under each piece of equipment an affiliate link to the product, if someone through that link came to the product and bought it you will earn a certain percentage of sales .
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Buyer</h4>
        <p>The ultimate goal of affiliate marketing is to connect the manufacturer with its customers for which you get a certain percentage of sales as a reward. If the buyer does not buy anything with it you will not get any percentage because the buyer is the main part of this system.</p>
        <h3>How To Get Started With Affiliate Marketing</h3>
        <p><strong>To start earning this way you need to contact the seller directly and get a link through which they will recognize you.</strong></p>
        <br>
<h3>How can products be promoted?</h3>
        <ul>
          
<li>Visited media portals</li>
<li>Mailing list</li>
<li>Sites focused on a specific niche</li>
<li>Influencers</li>

        </ul>
