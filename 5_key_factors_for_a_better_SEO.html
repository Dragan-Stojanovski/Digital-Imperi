<h1>Top 5 key factors for a better SEO (Search engine optimization) of your website.
</h1>

<h5>03.July.2022</h5>
<img class="article-photo" src="img/5_key_factors_for_a_better_SEO.webp">
<p>At first sight SEO optimization of your website looks complicated but it is not like that slowly you will understand it for sure. The basics of SEO optimization are quick to learn but going deeper and becoming an expert will take more time. I am not saying it is easy
  If it were easy, everyone would rank first on Google. But it is easier than it seems at first glance. Here I will introduce you to SEO optimization and teach you the basics.
  I have prepared a small guide for SEO optimization for beginners. If you want your site to rank high on Google, regardless of whether you will do it yourself or hire a professional agency, in any case, you must have basic knowledge of SEO. This guide contains the answers to all the questions that any beginner would have about SEO optimization.
  </p>
  <br>
<h2 style="font-size:150%;">What is SEO optimization?
</h2>
<p><strong>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization.</strong>
  We will explain it most easily if you want to be the first on Google you must:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Research keywords (words you want to rank for).</li>
    <li>To create very high-quality content.</li>
    <li>Be interesting to other websites so that they will attach links to their site that will lead to you.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  You can get lost very easily on this topic because there are too many courses, and materials that can confuse you very easily, especially because SEO is constantly changing, there is always something new, and every year it changes that what was important is no longer important or what was not important is now important. Google improves its algorithm daily based on it google is deciding which site will be ranked in which position.
<br>
But the basics (Keyword research, Creating original quality content and links from other websites)
are the basis of SEO optimization have been the same for the past 10 years and will likely remain the same for the next 10, 20 years.
<br>
Due to a lot of contradictory information, it is very easy to get lost and the question is whether you are ready to do the SEO optimization of your site yourself. Maybe when you reach a certain plateau you will need to hire an expert or an agency to help you overcome the current visitation plateau.

 </p>
<br>
<h4>It's better to progress slowly in the long run than quickly in the short run SEO optimization is a marathon, not a sprint.</h4>

<p><strong>Look at SEO optimization as a long-term investment as part of your marketing strategy SEO activities are ongoing and your business will only end when your business shuts down.
</strong>
SEO optimization is like building a house, for the house to be good, it must have solid foundations and be maintained, if it is done quickly, with high quality, it will collapse. Also, SEO optimization takes time, the more time it works, the more value it gains. You need a plan, concept, design, budget, and a lot of patience to achieve an increase in organic traffic to your website.
No one can guarantee you success with SEO optimization. If someone promises you reliable success, he is lying to you, there is no guarantee, no one can guarantee success because no one knows exactly the Google algorithm.

</p>
  <br>
  <h3>SEO optimization may not pay off if:
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You give up too soon
    </li>
    <li>You expect too fast results
    </li>
    <li>You are hiring the wrong people
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>And it can pay off:
  </h3>
  <p>It depends on the market. Let's say, for example, that you claim a certain keyword, if AdWords pays and you want to receive 200 clicks from potential customers per day, it will cost you about 60 euros per day or 1800 euros per month. With SEO optimization, you can get organic traffic that you won't pay for but have an investment to be able to rank high enough on google to get organic unpaid traffic.

    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Your site is your best employee
    </h2>

    <p>
      SEO optimization is important for businesses if you rank high, for example, a travel agency. Your potential customer is looking for where to go for a summer vacation and he needs it right away. Most likely the first three or four results on Google will catch his attention and he will travel with one of those companies.
      <br>
      <strong>In addition to good SEO optimization, it is important to have a good website because a good website is your best employee.
      </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Always works on weekends and holidays.
        </li>
        <li>It does not work only 8 hours a day, it works 24 hours 365 days a year.</li>

        <li>Day and night he receives calls, if not by phone, then through the contact form.
        </li>

        <li>He doesn't complain, he doesn't ask for special conditions, he's simply perfect.
        </li>

      </ul>
      <h4>Your website is your best employee, but it's not worth a lot without organic traffic, and this is where SEO optimization comes into play.
      </h4>
      <br>
      <h2>5 Key factors for SEO(Search engine optimization);
      </h2>
    
        <br>
        <h3>1. Accurate keyword research.
        </h3>

<p>The first thing you should do is thoroughly research the market for the keywords you want to rank for. If the agency you hired asks you what keywords you want to rank for then fire them. They don't know their business. it's not about what you want, but precise market research and finding the keywords that will help you get more organic traffic. For example, if you are a personal fitness trainer, you can try to rank for the keyword FITNESS, which is a highly searched keyword but it's hard to rank high because of the huge competition. It would be better to try to rank on another keyword that is less searched but less competition for example Personal training for football players. This would have fewer searches than FITNESS but it will be easier for you to get a higher rank on google.
  <br>
  By being new you are small in the gulch and you are entering a ranking battle with websites that have been around for a long time and your chances of ranking higher than them are very small. So when you are a new small site you need to move away from the battle with these big giants and try to rank on keywords that are less searched but you will have a higher chance of ranking.

  <br>
  <strong>How to do keyword research.
  </strong>
  <br>
  For the best keyword research, agencies use software that costs from 50 to 10,000 euros. But when you work on your website only you do not need such software, in your case, it would be best to use the free versions of this software that last for 30 days extract information, and cancel it.
It's a good option if you only work on your site.
You don't have to be the first on just one keyword, you can fight for ranking on multiple keywords.
The purpose of keyword research is to:
<ul>
  <li>Better understand your customers
  </li>
  <li>To know where it pays to spend time and money
  </li>

  <li>In order to create a good SEO strategy, it is necessary to know your potential customers well.
  </li>

</ul>
</p>

<br>
<h3>2.Find good content writers.</h3>
<p><strong>Content writing is a skill that not everyone possesses.
</strong><br>
If you find a content writer who knows SEO optimization then hire him and pay him a lot. He is a worthwhile employee and will bring you far more profit than you will pay for. A big problem is finding a quality content writer because most writers write school content and not for the internet.<br>
Good SEO agencies have good content writers who know how to write on any topic and make it optimized content. These content writers will write content that will bring you to the website and keep you there for a long period. They will come up with an attractive title. that will bring you to the page, they will also leave a motivational message that will further attract you to take an interest
</p>
<br>
   
<h3>
  3. Install Google Analytics

  </h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7421425?hl=en">Google Analytics</a> is a free tool from Google that is at your disposal and is one of the basic tools for any site.<br>
The basic function of Google Analytics is to track how many visits you have on your website, from which country they came, from which devices, and how long they stayed on your website.<br>
In short, Google Analytics is analytics for your site. Thus, through Google Analytics, you can track exactly how your website traffic is progressing and know exactly how much your SEO optimization is paying off.

  </p>
<br>
<h3>4. Optimize site for mobile devices
</h3>
<p>
  Perhaps 70% of your visits will come from users who use mobile phones, you can find accurate information through Google Analytics. Therefore, it is moral that your site is optimized for all devices, even Google favors sites that were originally made for mobile devices. The basis of Google's philosophy is that they want their users to be satisfied and therefore will not send them to a website that they will not be satisfied with.

</p>
<br>
<h3>5. Optimize site speed

</h3>
<p>
  Optimizing your site is important for SEO optimization because as mentioned that for google the most important thing is the satisfaction of its users if your site is slow it takes a long time to load and will not be a pleasant experience for users which can lower your ranking on google.<br>
You can check the speed of the site through <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">PageSpeed insights</a>. To optimize the speed of your site, the images you display must be optimized for the web.

</p>
<br>
<p>
  Track your progress all the time and work on optimizing your website as you rank higher the more important every part of your SEO strategy becomes.<br>
At the top, the difference between the first and second-ranked sites is the difference in details that are not visible and understandable for beginners.<br>
In this guide I have introduced you to the basics of SEO optimization, it is still up to you to develop and learn all the time because the Google algorithm changes daily and you must be up to date.
