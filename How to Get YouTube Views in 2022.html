<strong>There is no point in uploading a video if there are no views!</strong>
<br>
</p>

  <br>

If your videos fail to generate content, you must be making mistakes because the competition is not great and it is quite easy to get views and popularity compared to a website. <br>  <br>
  By the end of this guide to increasing YouTube views, you will know to boost your YouTube channel to get views that you can certainly use to make money. <br>  <br>
  In 2022 there are too many ways you can use YouTube views to earn money, everyone does this in their way. One of the basic and easiest ways is after you exceed 4000 hours of viewed videos and 1500 subscribers you can sign up and get approved. to become a Google partner, which means Google will display ads on your videos and you will be paid for it. This is the most basic and simplest way to monetize your YouTube channel, then you can use your channel to promote your products or your services.  <br>
 

 </p>
 <br>
 <div class="quote">
  <p>For example, if you work as a fitness trainer, you can share free exercise and nutrition tips on your YouTube channel, which will attract views, who are then potential customers for your services, such as a personalized diet plan or training plan. Many people. use YouTube by sharing interesting free content that will attract views and potential customers.
  </p>
 </div>
 <br>
 <h5>So let's get started</h5>
<br>
<h2>Quality content will get you more views on YouTube!

</h2>
<p>
  You might expect us to start with secrets and tricks, but that's not the case. First, start with the basics, after you've sorted out the basics, then you can delve deeper into the secrets. It's obvious, but we have to put quality content first if you're going to create quality videos, then your viewers will share with their friends and you will get free marketing and not just any but the best where you are promoted by satisfied viewers.<br><br>
Quality content gives value to the video, the length of the video does not make a difference whether the viewer will watch it to the end. If the video is 5 minutes with poor quality content, the viewer will watch half a minute and turn it off, disappointed with the quality of the content, it is simply not worth his time. If the video is 50 minutes long but has quality content it will keep the viewer for 50 minutes to stay and watch the whole video. Don't be afraid of the length of the video in recent studies it has been determined that the average mobile phone session spent on a YouTube video is 40 minutes.<br><br>
YouTube views do not depend on the quality of your production, to begin with, don't waste your resources on expensive production you will do it later, to begin with making sure you have quality content.<br><br>
To begin with, keep only the basics, for example, if your face is seen in the videos, make sure that everything is well lit and that the sound is clear.<br><br>
Once your videos attract attention, start thinking about investing in higher-quality production.

</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Optimize your video content to attract more viewers
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Title</li>
  <li>Tags
  </li>
  <li>Description
  </li>
  <li>Thumbnail</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Pay attention to your title
</h3>
<p>You should not create your title based on clickbait but you should make it so that it explains your keyword. For example, if your keyword is How to roast a chicken then a good title would be "How to roast a chicken (easy and simple)".
</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Use YouTube tags wisely
    </h3>
    <p>For the most traffic for tags, specify some keywords that relate to your video. Do not use more than 5-8 tags per video. By choosing precise tags, your video will appear in YouTube users' suggested videos.
  <br><br>    For the most traffic for tags, specify some keywords that relate to your video. Do not use more than 5-8 tags per video. By choosing precise tags, your video will appear in YouTube users' suggested videos while watching videos on a similar theme as yours.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Create a video description for your YouTube video.
      </h3>
      <p>In the video description be short and precise describe the video and what the viewers can learn from it don't try to cheat the YouTube algorithm with cheap tricks you can find on the internet like adding keywords and similar tricks you can achieve the opposite effect which it will ruin your video and won't reach the eyes of the viewers thus you will miss a chance for your video to break through.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Here's our guide to writing an optimized video description.
      </h3>
      <div class="quote">
        <ul>
          <li>The link should be at the top of the description
          </li>
          <li>Enter the keyword in the first 20 words
          </li>
          <li>The description of the video should be from 130 to 180 words</li>
          <li>Use the keyword bar 2 more times in the description</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <br>
      <h3>Take advantage of every opportunity</h3>
      <p>Use the internet use social networks use google use every chance you get to promote your video. You won't do much if you just make a video and upload it to YouTube.
    <br> 
    <img src="img/social-networks.jpeg" width="50%" > <strong> Let the world know you have something new to offer!</strong> 
        </p>
       
        <br><br>
        <h3>Increase the number of subscribers
        </h3>
        <p>
          Without a good base of loyal subscribers who will eagerly wait for you to release a video and open it as soon as they receive a notification, you will not be able to get serious views. The main factor to increase the number of subscribers is to create a relationship between you and your followers by posting constant videos. If you post a video once a month then they have no problem subscribing to your channel but if you post a new video often then they will subscribe so they don't miss any of your new videos.
<br><br>
To increase the number of subscribers at the beginning of the video and at the end remind them to subscribe when they read that your users are inclined to take action and subscribe.

        </p>
        <br>
        <div class="quote">
          <h3>Final conclusion
          </h3>
          <p>Increasing views on YouTube is unclear and seems too complex.<br>
            But in reality, it simply comes down to honest and hard work no tricks no scams. Simply create quality content that will give real value to your videos and success is inevitable.</p>
