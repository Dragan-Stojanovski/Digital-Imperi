<br>
<p>
  It's really easy to make extra money as a high school student in 2022 with all the opportunities the internet has to offer, but in most cases, the problem is that most teenagers think they don't have time because of school but the truth is they're just lazy!

  OUR ADVICE (IMPORTANT): Don't be lied to by your parents and relatives from older generations that you should work and immediately get money for it. All the things where you earn money immediately are short-lived and have no value or growth potential, while with online earning you must be patient, it will take you from 2 to 4 months to reach the first income, and the first paycheck is going to be minimal but significant and will encourage you to be more focused and dedicated, after 6 months the income becomes more serious and after 1 year you already have an internet business which has huge potential to grow.
  
</p>
<br>
<h2>1. Start your blog (Our Recommendation)</h2>
<p>
  The first recommendation for high school students who want to earn extra money by working online is to create a blog.
  <br><br>First, let's give you a clear picture of what a blog is.
  <br><br>A blog is a website that you regularly update and upgrade with information such as texts, images, and videos.
  <br><br>For example, our page where you are reading this guide is a kind of blog, we update it regularly and supplement it with new articles.
  <br><br>In our opinion, blogging is one of the best ways to earn if you are patient and the investments are minimal. First, you need to choose a topic on which you will write, our recommendation is to choose a topic for which you already have quality knowledge on that topic and you will be competitive in the market. If you do not have high knowledge of the topic you are writing about, your content will not have real value and will not be worth your reader's time.
Update your website constantly and add quality content be patient give yourself time to rank on Google and increase organic traffic. Once you get good traffic to your website you are ready to monetize your work some of the best ways to monetize your blog are:
<br><br>

</p>
<ul>
  <li>Affiliate Marketing
  </li>
  <li>Google AdSense
  </li>
  <li>Sell ad space
  </li>
  <li>Sell products
  </li>
  <li>Sell services
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  2.Record For YouTube & Earn Money

</h2>
<p>
  Nowadays this is one of the easiest ways to make money on the internet. Because it is easy to make videos for YouTube this is also the most popular way to make money online, especially for young people. You can make any kind of content there are no restrictions if you want to play video games feel free to record yourself or you want to record guides on how to work out in the gym or at home. All you need is a subject for recording a camera or a phone for recording and an editing program our recommendation is Adobe PremierePro one of the best programs for editing videos as well as simple to use. You're all set, all you have to do is record and upload, which is super easy.
<br><br><strong>Now let's explain how to monetize your work:</strong>
</p>

<h3>
  Google AdSense
</h3>
<p>
  The easiest way to monetize your YouTube channel is through AdSense.
  <br>
Your channel should have 1000 followers and a minimum of 4000 hours watch hours.

</p>

<h3>
  Sponsorships
</h3>
<p>
  You can also monetize your channel through sponsorships because you have an audience that follows you. If you have a lot of traffic, some companies will want to advertise on your videos you can do it by praising one of their products or saying how you use that product only with the idea of ​​drawing the attention of the audience to that product.
<br><br>
  Your client receives an advertisement for his product or services and you receive a pre-agreed monetary compensation.

</p>

<h3>
  Selling your products/services

</h3>
<p>
  
If you have reached a certain number of visitors to your videos, you have a community that follows you and your work. After a certain time, you can use the audience you have to sell them a product or service if you have something to offer. If you have nothing to offer offers to your subscribers you can switch to affiliate marketing by promoting someone else's product or services and for every product, you sell as a reward you get a certain percentage of the selling price of the product.

</p>
<br>
<h2>
  Start Writing Content (Freelance)

</h2>
<p>
  Freelancing is a business opportunity of the 21st century where you have the freedom to work from where you want, when you want, how much you want, and most importantly choose who you will work with.
<br><br>
  Content writers are currently the most sought-after on freelance platforms. If you know English or, even better, other languages ​​such as Spanish, German, or Italian, you are ready to start working as a content writer on popular freelance platforms.
  <br><br>Our recommendation is to start at Upwork or Fveer as proven safe platforms where you have a guarantee that you will be paid.
  <br><br>To begin with, be humble, getting the first 10 clients is the hardest part of becoming a successful freelancer.
  <br><br>After you have completed several contracts, you will receive a positive opinion from your client, which will make it much easier for you to reach the next clients.
  <br><br>Content writers are in demand on the world market because they are working from the comfort of their homes. Freelancers' potential customers are everyone on the internet.
The good thing is that you don't have any investments, only hard work and most importantly don't give up.

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    In this guide, I've listed the top 3 ways to make money online as a high school student. We're not writing about clicking ads or filling out surveys for one simple reason.
<br><br>Because they won't help you earn money, they are invented for lazy people who don't want to put in the effort and time to earn money.
<br><br>People lie to themselves, they look for a quick and easy way to lose weight, they drink all kinds of pills, and liquids, even though they know themselves that the right way is simple, they should reduce food and be physically active, but it's easier for them to lie to themselves. It's the same in the business world, even though we know that to get a good income you need a lot of time, energy, knowledge, and most importantly patience. An empire is not built in a day. If you are serious about starting to earn online and one day it will become a successful business with 7 figure income then take it seriously the advice I gave you above.
