<h2 style="font-size:200%;">What is a Freelancer?</h2>
<p>The freelancer does not work for a company but works for himself(Self-employed). He can make cooperation agreements with companies, but he is still self-employed.
  The advantage of Freelancing is that you have the freedom to determine your working hours, and how much you will charge, whether per hour or project. Freelancers are not counted as employees of the companies they work with but as collaborators.
  
 </p>
<br>
<h2>Pros and Cons of Freelancing</h2>

<p>There are positive and negative things in every job. There is no job that is perfect in all aspects and so is freelancing.
</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Pros of Freelancing</h3>
  <p>You have control over where you work, under how much pressure you will work, you have the opportunity to choose which clients you will cooperate with and which you will not, unlike working in a company where you have to work according to what is given to you.
    And most importantly, you decide for yourself how much money you will work for and all the money remains for you, no company will keep a part for itself and give you a part of the earnings.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Cons of Freelancing</h3>

    <p>Starting as a freelancer and getting your first projects when nobody knows anything about you can be a pain in the ass. The first projects are the hardest to get after a few positive reviews the whole process is much easier. You're not registered you don't have health insurance, you will have to fix it yourself, you don't have paid sick leave, and you don't even have a secure job, for a small glitch you can be banned from the platform you work on, which will set you back a lot in your career.
      But still, the freedom that is given from freelancing can't be compared with anything else, and it's worth giving a try.
