<h1>How to effectively advertise on the Internet

</h1>

<h5>05.July.2022</h5>
<img class="article-photo" src="img/How_to_effectievly_advertise_on_the_Internet.jpeg">
<p><strong>First, we will define how not to advertise on the internet and how not to waste your money on wrong marketing strategies.
</strong>
  </p>
  <br>
<h2 style="font-size:150%;">Banner ads are a waste of time, money, and energy.
</h2>
<p>
  Banner ads on the internet are just like billboard ads in the real world. In most cases, renting a banner ad is a waste of your money. Because no one clicks on them, they are of no interest to users because banners have been around for as long as there is the internet. Users are taught while using the internet to avoid anything that looks like an advertisement.
<br>
<strong>An advantage of online advertising and something we must do is to measure and track user interaction with our ad.
</strong>
<br>
The point of a good ad on the internet is not just to have a creative, interesting design and other fancy things. A good ad is the one that increases sales, that's the beginning and the end of everything else is a marketing scam.
To know if your ad is profitable you must measure the results of the ad, for starters you must have at least <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7421425?hl=en">Google Analytics</a> installed.

 </p>
<br>
<h2>
  3 Ðœost important things about online advertising
  </h2>
<p>When you take your business online you must forget the old ways of advertising that you used to do before. For a successful online advertisement that will increase your sales all
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Visits on your site
  </li>
  <li>Conversation with visitors to your site
  </li>
  <li>A communication channel with your customers that will continue your interaction
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
  First and foremost you MUST have traffic to your website. If your site has no traffic then you have no one to sell your services to. To profit from traffic to your site the most important thing is that your visitors are a relevant, well-targeted group of users who are interested in your services and want to buy what you sell. And the second thing is that those visits should be cheap.
<br><br>
Free visits through Google or known as organic visits are visits to your site so that you rank high on Google when someone searches for something relevant to your services you will pop up among the first results of Google and thus you will get a "free" visit.
Or advertise through Google AdWords so that Google advertises you and charges you for each click on your ad.
<br><br>
You must be aware that<strong> nowadays there are no free visits.</strong> And those visits that are presented to us as "free" in reality are not free. To get organic visits without paying for ads you need to invest money in developing good SEO ( Search Engine Optimization) a strategy that will bring you to appear in the first positions of Google for certain keywords.
<br><br>
You have two ways to get attendance one is the instant fast way and the other way is slow but long-lasting.
<br><br>
The instant fast way to increase traffic to your site is always paid so that you pay a certain amount for each offer and this method, although it brings instant results, does not last long, as soon as you run out of money, the visits to your site will stop.
<br><br>
While the slow way of getting visits is far more stable. It is an investment that you make now and the first results will come in a year if you are persistent and your strategy is quality, and in two or three years the results will raise you to the top in your industry from where hardly anyone will take you away. This way implies investing in SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
<br><br>
Another way of free advertising on the Internet is to open profiles and fan pages on social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. Where potential customers can follow you and keep up with your activities for free.
</p>
  <br>
  <h2>3 Main ways to advertise on the internet

  </h2>
 <p>The main channels that will bring visits to your site are SEO (Search Engine Optimization), Facebook paid ads, and Google ads. These channels for increasing traffic to your site if in the wrong hands can be a total waste of time and money.
</p>
<br>
  <h3>1.Google Ads, AdWords (pay per click)
  </h3>
  <p>Google ads are great if you offer a solution to a specific problem. That's how google works, someone searches for a solution to a problem they have, and google offers them suggestions on how to solve the problem. It's important to have a quality website that will retain visitors once they arrive. Many factors influence how much money advertising on Google will cost, depending on which region you are advertising in, which industry you are in, and if the site is of poor quality, then the ads would cost more.


    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>2.Facebook paid ads

    </h3>

    <p>
      Facebook is a huge community, almost everyone has a registered profile on this social network, if someone doesn't have an account, then surely someone close to them has an account. It doesn't pay to advertise if you are aggressive, don't advertise on Partner Networks like Instagram or in the sidebar of Desktop. Advertise only through Mobile newsfeed. You should be concerned with your Relevance Score, if your ad is liked by Facebook users, then Facebook will advertise you for less money. If your ad is not liked by Facebook users, then Facebook will charge you a lot to show an ad that its users don't like.


      </p>
   <br>
      <h3>3.SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

      </h3>
      <p>Known as a way to get free traffic to your site, which is not the case. In order to rank high on Google, you need money and time. You must have quality content on your website, and in order to have it, you must dedicate time to writing or otherwise. hiring a professional content writer will cost you money. Then you must have an SEO expert who knows how to optimize your website which also costs you money. The best way to get long-term traffic to your site is to combine good content on your site with a good SEO strategy, this strategy will make your site high-quality and well-ranked, for which you will receive visits at the moment and for the same content you will receive visits in two years.
      </p>

      <h5>In the battle for Internet advertising, whoever is willing to spend more money always wins.
