<p>
  In 2022, TikTok has evolved and changed. It is no longer a social network where teenagers sing and dance. It has turned into a platform that contains all kinds of content, from a full day of eating up to a day in the life of a doctor or astronaut.
<br><br>
It is for these reasons that TikTok achieved its success. Any type of content can succeed on this social network, while on Facebook and Twitter you are quite limited in your creativity.
<br><br>
TikTok monitors every piece of content carefully and gives every clip a chance by showing it to its users, even if you don't have any followers, your video will be seen by many users. If users like it, be ready for your account to go viral, that's why your content must be quality. 
<br><br>
<div class="quote">High-quality content is your ticket to virality.
</div>

 </p>
<br><br>
<h2>We're going to give you some tips on how to get a viral video on TikTok.


<br>

<h3>1. Stunning intro to your video!
</h3>
<p>

  Life on TikTok is fast and dynamic so you have to attract its users do not let them pass your video to watch other content. So put the most attractive part at the beginning to attract the attention of users to stop to watch your video.

  </h3>
<p>
  Keep your videos short and to the point. TikTok rates videos by what percentage of the video has been viewed so it's much more likely that someone will view 8 seconds of a 10-second video than 48 seconds of a 1-minute video.

  </p>
<br>
<h3>3. Record yourself
</h3>
<p>With the help of comments and hashtags, TikTok tries to show the right content to the right users who will be interested in that content. In addition to comments and hashtags, you can help TikTok show your video to the right audience by recording yourself. with the help of your phone or a microphone, during which he will receive many keywords that will help him present you to the right audience.
</p>

<h3>5. Share quick tips and tricks.
</h3>
