<h2>Beginner's Guide to Dropshipping
</h2>
<p>
  If you've been looking for a way to make money online, you've probably come across dropshipping and many success stories of people who have made large sums of money from dropshipping. In this guide, we will introduce you to dropshipping and how you can start this kind of online earning from the comfort of your home. The key in dropshipping as in any other online business is to be patient, an empire is not built in a day.
  <br><br>
  We hope that our guide will help you understand dropshipping and the potential benefits of this online business and we believe that if you do it right and long enough the earnings are guaranteed.

</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Introducing dropshipping</h3>
<p>
  Dropshipping becomes a popular business model in 2007 when <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/">AliExpress</a> and other online platforms become popular and people shop online more and more often. At that time, dropshipping is not so popular and only a few merchants take advantage of the opportunity to make money thanks to the low prices of products on Amazon AliExpress and other online stores.
<br><br>
  After 15 years dropshipping is one of the most popular and profitable online businesses with a huge increase in the last 4 years thanks to the Covid-19 crisis when people realized that shopping online is the simplest easy fast way to shop and most importantly the safest because it avoids contact with others people.

</p>
<br><br>
<h3>How does dropshipping work?
</h3>
<p>
  Dropshipping is difficult for many people to understand. They cannot understand how you can be a merchant and sell goods without having a warehouse, accounting, or distribution.
<br><br>That's the biggest advantage of dropshipping and why it's one of the most popular ways to make money online in 2022, you have the freedom to sell goods all over the world working from your computer and nothing more. Drop shipping is a way of trading where your job is only to find a customer for a certain product from famous online stores around the world, after you agree to sell a certain product to your customer, it remains for you to find that product on Amazon or AliExpress and order it to be delivered to your customer's address.
<br><br>If the product is $10 on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, you sell it to the customer for $13 and use Amazon's warehouses and distribution system to deliver the product to the customer.
<br><br>With the dropshipping business model, you save and avoid all the complications that a physical store or an e-store has, such as costs for renting a warehouse, then organizing distribution and general costs that anyone who starts an online store has.

</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Advantages of Dropshipping</h3>
<p>
<strong>-Easy to start:</strong> To get started all you need is a channel through which you will sell products whether it be a social network, a list of e-mail addresses, and our recommendation to create or hire a developer to create a website for you to sell on your products because with a Website you look serious and instill the most confidence in your users to choose you.
<br><br><strong>-Small initial capital:</strong> Your only investment is in hosting your website on which you will sell your services, which is a huge advantage of dropshipping, anyone can start with minimal driving, unlike traditional stores where you have large investments at the start.
<br><br><strong>-You have nothing to lose:</strong> In this trading model you do not have a warehouse with a stock of goods in which you have invested so if you fail to sell it you will have to throw it away. In dropshipping you have no warehouse with goods which gives you freedom if you decide that you don't correspond to this way of online earning, you can close the website at the same moment and you are free, not bound by anything.

</p>
<br>
<h3>Cons of Dropshiping</h3>
<p>
  <strong>-Low-profit margin:</strong> You have to go with low-margin products for example if an Amazon product is 32$ you have to sell it for 35$ which is a low profit but you have to fight to offer a low price for your products because the competition is relentless if you don't reduce the price your competitor will. The competition in 2022 is huge so be ready to fight for every user.
<br><br>  <strong>-You are responsible for the products:</strong> If the online store from which you resell products makes a mistake in the order or is late with the delivery, then you are responsible for it to your customer because he is working with you and is not aware of the reality of how you sell the product to him.
   <br> <br><strong>-Limited progress:</strong> Even though you can get big earnings but you are still limited your supplier has the product it is his brand you are just a middleman in a way.
<br><br>You don't have the chance to brand the products you sell to your customers which doesn't allow you to raise the price for the sake of the brand you are building so you are limited to a minimum profit per product.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Can Anyone Start Dropshipping?
</h3>
<p>
  Anyone can start dropshipping, no person cannot develop a dropshipping business if they have access to a computer and an internet connection.
<br><br>You don't need any experience in trading or programming nowadays, with a few clicks you can get your website and there is a lot of information on the internet about how to get started and how to progress in any field.
<br><br>Dropshipping can be your main job from which you will earn money, and it can also be a side job in addition to your full-time job. Extra income in the family budget never hurt anyone.

</p>
<br>
<h2>How to get started with dropshiping?
</h2>
<h4><strong>Step 1: Choose products for your store</strong>
</h4>
<p>One of the most important factors is what you sell if you sell interesting quality products someone will inevitably buy them if you choose to sell poor quality products then you will not last long.
</p>
<br>
<h4><strong>Step 2: Analysis of the market and competitors</strong>
</h4>
<p>The first thing you should do when starting any business is to do a quick google search for your competition, open them and familiarize yourself with their offers and content and see what you can offer better than them, find their weaknesses, and make them your strengths. You must find a way to be better than your competitors so that customers choose you.
</p>
<br>
<div class="quote">
  <h5>If you don't offer anything better than your competitors why do you think a customer would buy from you?</h5>
</div>
<br>
<h4><strong>Step 3: Find a supplier</strong></h4>
<p>
  Dropshipping consists of three parts: the supplier who delivers the goods, you as an intermediary, and the customer who buys the goods. It is important that the supplier you choose is reliable and that you have maximum confidence in him and their services to make sure that with his help, you will supply your customers with certain products on time. If your supplier cheats on you by being late and does not deliver the products you ordered, it will not affect him because the customers cooperate with you.
<br><br>The revolt of the dissatisfied customer will be poured out on you.

</p>
<br>
<h4><strong>Step 4: Promoting your Dropshipping company</strong>
</h4>
<p>Now that you have secured a website on which you will offer your products, you have a supplier, now it remains to work out a good marketing strategy that will help you secure customers for your products.

  <h4>Dropshipping is an online store that does not have its own warehouse, employees, or distribution, you are an intermediary with the help of your website and for each product sold, you receive a portion of the amount you provide depending on yourself.</h4>
