<img class="article-photo" src="img/why_your_business_needs_website.webp">
<h3>Available anytime, anywhere!
</h3>
<p>The ability to shop online is a big advantage whether you are buying from a mobile or a computer, this is especially important in 2021 when online shopping is more and more relevant due to the new situation due to covid-19.

  Nowadays one of the best investments for any company, whether small or large, is owning your website. Which will allow you to present your services and products 24/7 on the Internet. Your business will be available at any time regardless of the adopted Covid-19 measures that may adversely affect your business and profit.
  Online sales increased by 39% in 2021/2022
  E-commerce is booming. Data from some research indicates that e-commerce is booming worldwide, especially after the Covid-19 crisis as a business owner, it is important to stay up to date with current trends.
  </p>
<br>
<h2>Expand your customer list!
</h2>

<p>During Covid-19, people buy things online more than ever. Data show that 80% of people prefer to shop online rather than go to the store.
  Even though the pandemic has extinguished many things, search engines like Google have given us a chance to make our products easily available on the Internet. People started spending their money online in the last few years because that is the easiest and safest way to buy whatever you need. Besides a good website, you will need a good marketing strategy and SEO(Search engine optimization) that will increase your visibility and this will increase your list of potential customers. Why sell only in your city or country when you have the opportunity to sell worldwide!
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Unlimited source of information</h3>
  <p>The website will be your main source of information about your services or products to your customers. The website is one of the first places your customers go to find more information about you. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many people use the internet to find information about the company that interests them.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Improve your customer service
  </h3>
  <p>With your website, you will significantly improve the service you offer to your customers. There are many features and useful tools that can improve communication with your customers such as online chat, contact forms, or feedback surveys that will help customers get in touch with you and the information they are interested in faster and easier.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Increase your credibility.
  </h3>
  <p>Having your own website that displays accurate information about you is crucial to increasing the credibility of your business. Your customers will know that you are proud of what you offer and that you do not need to hide it. And to be realistic, if your business is not online, you are "invisible".
    One of the biggest reasons why your business needs an online store is that the web store has no geographical restrictions and you are available worldwide.
