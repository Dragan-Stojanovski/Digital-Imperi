 </p>
<br>
<h3>In short, WordPress is the best and simplest way to build your website.
</h3>
<br><br>
<h2>What types of websites can you create with WordPress?
</h2>

<p>In the beginning, WordPress was limited in that you could only build a simple blog site far simpler than the ones we see nowadays. Thanks to the changes, today with its help we can create all kinds of websites without any restrictions.

  <h3>The history of WordPress

  </h3>
  <p>
    WordPress was created in 2003 by Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little. Today, behind WordPress stands a whole team of professionals who make sure everything works flawlessly.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    Over the years WordPress has been upgraded and thanks to all the improvements over the years it has become the most popular platform for building websites.

  </p>
    <br>
    <h4>-Good sense for visual design</h4>

    <p>A good sense of visual beauty is knowing how to choose the right design color typography images for your site so that it will be more comfortable to use and visually beautiful is very close to the user experience.
    </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Who is WordPress for?

      </h3>
      <p>WordPress is for all users, regardless of whether you are a large company, a large business, or an individual, WordPress is the right choice for creating your website.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Why do we recommend you to build your website in WordPress?
        </h3>
        <p>
          WordPress is used by large well-known companies such as Microsoft and Skype, more than 34% of all websites on the Internet are created using WordPress.
          </p>
          <br>
        <h4>In this section, we will list only some of the benefits of why WordPress has gained so much popularity among developers around the world.
        </h4>
        <h3>Word press is Free to use
        </h3>
        <p>
          The advantage of WordPress compared to other platforms for creating websites is that it is free of charge, unlike other platforms that charge you for their services and are not of the same quality as WordPress. If you create your website, you will only pay for hosting. where you will upload your site to the internet.
<br><br>
          The biggest advantage of WordPress compared to other platforms besides being free is that there are many free themes and plugins for your website that will set it apart from the rest.

          </p>
        <br><br>
<h3>WordPress is extensible

</h3>
       <p>WordPress offers you a small million plugins with the help of which you can very easily manipulate the appearance of your website, while you don't need any knowledge of coding.
<br><br>
<strong>Themes-</strong>Primarily used to change the appearance of your website.
<br>
<strong>Plugins-</strong>
 serve to improve the functionality of the website. Add-ons such as a contact form or to install an add-on for an E-Shop. At any moment, WordPress has over 45,000 free add-ons to install and over 5,000 themes that you can choose from depending on what you want to achieve with your website.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>WordPress is easy to manage
      </h3>
      <p>We have already mentioned, but it should be repeated, the biggest benefit of using WordPress to build your website. It is very easy to manage the content of your website, and add and remove elements, there are plugins for everything, by installing a single element such as bbPress you can add a forum to your website, while if you wanted to add a forum using code it would take too much time unlike WordPress where you just install a plugin and the problem is solved.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>It is easy to find solutions to any problem

      </h3>
      <p>Because WordPress is widely used, it has a large base of users who share solutions to the problems they have encountered, so no matter what problem you have, the solution is already on the Internet.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>The best way to build your website.
      </h3>
      <p>
        We should clarify that WordPress.org and WordPress.com are not the same things. <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> is the free version to use WordPress while <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> is the premium paid version. 
        <br><br>
        <strong>Our recommendation is to use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> version where you will have total access to your website and it won't cost you anything. If you are thinking of making a website for your business or starting to write blogs then WordPress is the right choice for you.</strong>
